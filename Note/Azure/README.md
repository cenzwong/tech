## What is the difference between Azure VPN Gateway and Virtual network gateway. List them in a table.

A VPN gateway is a specific type of virtual network gateway that is used to send traffic between an Azure virtual network and an on-premises location over the public internet. You can also use a VPN gateway to send traffic between Azure virtual networks ². When you create a virtual network gateway resource in Azure, you can select the VPN or ExpressRoute gateway type in Azure ¹.

Here is a table that summarizes the differences between Azure VPN Gateway and Virtual Network Gateway:

| Azure VPN Gateway | Virtual Network Gateway |
| --- | --- |
| A specific type of virtual network gateway | A general term for a gateway that can be either VPN or ExpressRoute |
| Used to send traffic between an Azure virtual network and an on-premises location over the public internet | Can be used to send traffic between an Azure virtual network and an on-premises location over the public internet or a private connection |
| Can also be used to send traffic between Azure virtual networks | Can also be used to send traffic between Azure virtual networks |

## What is the difference between, policy-based VPN gateway, route-based VPN gateway and path-based VPN gateway. List them in table.

A policy-based VPN gateway uses the combinations of prefixes from both networks to define how traffic is encrypted/decrypted through IPsec tunnels. It is typically built on firewall devices that perform packet filtering. IPsec tunnel encryption and decryption are added to the packet filtering and processing engine ¹.

A route-based VPN gateway uses routes that are added to a virtual private gateway to direct traffic to the IPsec tunnel. These routes can be configured statically or dynamically using routing protocols ¹.

I couldn't find any information about a path-based VPN gateway. It's possible that you may have mistaken the term. Could you please clarify if you meant something else?

Here is a table that summarizes the differences between policy-based VPN gateway and route-based VPN gateway:

| Policy-based VPN Gateway | Route-based VPN Gateway |
| --- | --- |
| Uses combinations of prefixes from both networks to define how traffic is encrypted/decrypted through IPsec tunnels | Uses routes that are added to a virtual private gateway to direct traffic to the IPsec tunnel |
| Typically built on firewall devices that perform packet filtering | Routes can be configured statically or dynamically using routing protocols |

## What is the difference between 1. NAT rule collection, 2. Network rule collection, 3. Application rule collection? List them in a table.



In Azure Firewall, there are three types of rule collections: NAT, Network, and Application. Rule Collection Groups contain zero or more Rule Collections. You can define multiple Rule Collection types within a single Rule Group. You can define zero or more Rules in a Rule Collection. Rules in a Rule Collection must be of the same type (NAT, Network, or Application)¹.

Here is a table that summarizes the differences between the three types of rule collections:

| Rule Collection Type | Description |
| --- | --- |
| NAT | NAT collection supports having a list of NAT rules². |
| Network | Network collection supports including a list of network rules². |
| Application | Application collection supports including a list of application rules². |

## Compare Azure ExpressRoute and Azure Virtual WAN. List them in a table.

Azure ExpressRoute is a service that lets you extend your on-premises networks into the Microsoft cloud over a private connection with the help of a connectivity provider. With ExpressRoute, you can establish connections to Microsoft cloud services, such as Microsoft Azure and Microsoft 365⁴.

Azure Virtual WAN is a networking service that brings many networking, security, and routing functionalities together to provide a single operational interface. Some of the main features include branch connectivity (via connectivity automation from Virtual WAN Partner devices such as SD-WAN or VPN CPE) and site-to-site VPN connectivity⁷.

Here is a table comparing the two services:

| Azure ExpressRoute | Azure Virtual WAN |
| --- | --- |
| Private connection to Microsoft cloud services | Networking service with many functionalities |
| Extend on-premises networks into the Microsoft cloud | Single operational interface |
| Establish connections to Microsoft Azure and Microsoft 365 | Branch connectivity and site-to-site VPN connectivity |
