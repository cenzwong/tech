## Design a data storage solution for non-relational data

### Things to consider when choosing data storage
| Azure Storage Option | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Blob Storage | Store vast amounts of unstructured data. Often used for images and multimedia files. |
| Files | Provide fully managed file shares in the cloud. Accessible via SMB, NFS protocols and Azure Files REST API. |
| Managed Disks | Support Azure Virtual Machines with block-level storage volumes managed by Azure. Perform like physical disks in an on-premises server but in a virtual environment. |
| Queue Storage | Store large numbers of messages to create a backlog of work to process asynchronously. |

### Things to consider when choosing storage accounts

| Consideration | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Storage Locations | Locate data storage close to where it's most frequently used to increase performance. |
| Compliance Requirements | Examine regulatory guidelines for business scenarios. Different storage accounts may be required to meet different requirements. |
| Data Storage Costs | Factor in data storage costs into your plan. The settings you choose for the account influence the cost of services in the account. Multiple storage accounts can help control overall costs. |
| Replication Scenarios | Configure data storage to support different replication strategies. Partition data into critical and non-critical categories and place them in different storage accounts with appropriate redundancy options. |
| Administrative Overhead | Plan for administrative overhead in your storage design. Each storage account requires time and attention from an administrator to create and maintain.

### Things to know about data redundancy

| Characteristic | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Redundancy | Achieved by replicating data to a primary region. |
| Primary Region | Selected when creating a storage account. Supports two replication options: LRS and ZRS. |
| Secondary Region | Recommended for applications that require high durability. Paired secondary region is determined based on the primary region and can't be changed. Usually distant from the primary region to protect against regional disasters. Supports two replication options: GRS and GZRS. |

### Things to consider when using data redundancy

| Consideration | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Primary Replication Options | Explore different scenarios for data replication in the primary region. Implement multiple storage accounts with different redundancy to control overall costs. |
| Locally Redundant Storage (LRS) | Low cost redundancy solution with limited durability. Suited for apps that store data that can be easily reconstructed or have data governance requirements. |
| Zone-Redundant Storage (ZRS) | Excellent performance, low latency and resiliency for temporarily unavailable data. Might not protect against regional disasters affecting multiple zones. |
| Secondary Regions | For high durability, copy data to a secondary region hundreds of miles away from the primary region. Data is durable even in case of complete regional outage or disaster. |
| Read Access Requirements | Identify applications requiring read access to replicated data in secondary region if primary region becomes unavailable. Configure storage account with read access to secondary region.

### Things to know about Azure blob access tiers

| Access Tier | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Premium Blob Storage | Best suited for I/O intensive workloads requiring low and consistent storage latency. Uses SSDs for fast and consistent response times. Best for workloads performing many small transactions. |
| Hot Access Tier | Lowest access costs but higher storage costs than Cool and Archive tiers. Optimized for frequent reads and writes of objects in the storage account. Good for data actively being processed. |
| Cool Access Tier | Lower storage costs but higher access costs compared to Hot tier. Optimized for storing large amounts of infrequently accessed data. Intended for data remaining in Cool tier for at least 30 days. Good for short-term backup and disaster recovery datasets and older media content. |
| Archive Access Tier | Most cost-effective option for storing data but accessing data is more expensive than other tiers. Offline tier optimized for data tolerating several hours of retrieval latency. Data must remain in Archive tier for at least 180 days or be subject to early deletion charge.
