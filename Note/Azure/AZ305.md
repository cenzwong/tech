## Design a data storage solution for non-relational data

### Things to consider when choosing data storage
| Azure Storage Option | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Blob Storage | Store vast amounts of unstructured data. Often used for images and multimedia files. |
| Files | Provide fully managed file shares in the cloud. Accessible via SMB, NFS protocols and Azure Files REST API. |
| Managed Disks | Support Azure Virtual Machines with block-level storage volumes managed by Azure. Perform like physical disks in an on-premises server but in a virtual environment. |
| Queue Storage | Store large numbers of messages to create a backlog of work to process asynchronously. |

<td>Blob Storage (including Data Lake Storage)</td>
<td>Premium storage account for block blobs and append blobs. Recommended for applications with high transaction rates. Use Premium block blobs if you work with smaller objects or require consistently low storage latency. This storage is designed to scale with your applications.</td>

<td>Azure Files</td>
<td>Premium storage account for file shares only. Recommended for enterprise or high-performance scale applications. Use Premium file shares if you require support for both Server Message Block (SMB) and NFS file shares.</td>

<td>Page blobs only</td>
<td>Premium high-performance storage account for page blobs only. Page blobs are ideal for storing index-based and sparse data structures, such as operating systems, data disks for virtual machines, and databases.</td>

### Things to consider when choosing storage accounts

| Consideration | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Storage Locations | Locate data storage close to where it's most frequently used to increase performance. |
| Compliance Requirements | Examine regulatory guidelines for business scenarios. Different storage accounts may be required to meet different requirements. |
| Data Storage Costs | Factor in data storage costs into your plan. The settings you choose for the account influence the cost of services in the account. Multiple storage accounts can help control overall costs. |
| Replication Scenarios | Configure data storage to support different replication strategies. Partition data into critical and non-critical categories and place them in different storage accounts with appropriate redundancy options. |
| Administrative Overhead | Plan for administrative overhead in your storage design. Each storage account requires time and attention from an administrator to create and maintain.
