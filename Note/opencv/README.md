https://pypi.org/project/opencv-python/
Unofficial pre-built CPU-only OpenCV packages for Python.

```
This sometimes work on linux and when you run this on linux, immediately you can get the import cv2

Sometime you got some error in jupyter environment
try:
```
pip install opencv-python-headless
```

## Method two (Python)
Installing OpenCV-Python from Pre-built Binaries
This method serves best when using just for programming and developing OpenCV applications.
```bash
sudo apt-get install python-opencv

print(cv.__version__)
```
Apt repositories may not contain the latest version of OpenCV always
