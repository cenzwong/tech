## How to provision AWS resources
- AWS Management Console
- AWS CLI
- Software Development Kits
- AWS Elastic Beanstalk
    - Instead of clicking around the console or writing multiple commands to build out your network, EC2 instances, scaling and Elastic Load Balancers, you can instead provide your application code and desired configurations to the AWS Elastic Beanstalk service, which then takes that information and builds out your environment for you. 
- AWS CloudFormation
    - AWS CloudFormation is an infrastructure as code tool that allows you to define a wide variety of AWS resources in a declarative way using JSON or YAML text-based documents called CloudFormation templates.

# Networking
- Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (Amazon VPC)
- Internet gateway
- Virtual private gateway
- AWS Direct Connect

## Subnets
![](https://assets.skillbuilder.aws/files/a/w/aws_prod1_docebosaas_com/1657958400/C9khKeuFVAcm75zvzkQubw/tincan/31d9c0cca79c54bdceaf3e938fd424e97c98c7e8/assets/-HQN-9SqkWc5e-yv_pi4TpfvEYaalWuIu.png)

In a VPC, subnets can communicate with each other. For example, you might have an application that involves Amazon EC2 instances in a public subnet communicating with databases that are located in a private subnet.

## Network access control lists (ACLs)
- A network access control list (ACL) is a virtual firewall that controls inbound and outbound traffic at the subnet level.
- Network ACLs perform stateless packet filtering. They remember nothing and check packets that cross the subnet border each way: inbound and outbound. 
- By default, your accountâ€™s default network ACL allows all inbound and outbound traffic

## Security groups
- A security group is a virtual firewall that controls inbound and outbound traffic for an Amazon EC2 instance.
- By default, a security group denies all inbound traffic and allows all outbound traffic. You can add custom rules to configure which traffic to allow or deny.
- Security groups perform stateful packet filtering. They remember previous decisions made for incoming packets.

## Global Networking
- Amazon Route 53
    - DNS web service
    - AWS Route 53 takes its name with reference to Port 53, which handles DNS for both the TCP and UDP traffic requests
