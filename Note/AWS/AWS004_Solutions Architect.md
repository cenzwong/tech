# 1. Software Architecture and DevOps

Software development is a process by which standalone or individual software is created using a specific programming language. It involves writing a series of interrelated programming code, which provides the functionality of the developed software. Software development may also be called application development and software design.
Topics:
- Architecture
  - Architecture Tradeoff Analysis Method (ATAM)
  - UML Diagrams
  - Infrastructure as Code
    - AWS Service Catalog
    - AWS Config, and AWS CloudTrail: Operations Management
    - Amazon CloudWatch: Monitoring and Logging
    - AWS CloudFormation: Provisioning
    - AWS OpsWorks: Managed Services for Configuration Management
- DevOps
  - Continuous Integration
    - DevOps software development practice where developers regularly merge their code changes into a central repository, after which automated builds and tests are run. 
  - Continuous Delivery
    - DevOps software development practice where code changes are automatically built, tested, and prepared for a release to production.
